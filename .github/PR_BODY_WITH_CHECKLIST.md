Why this PR exists\n\nThis is a small but structural refinement pass  tightening the introspection arc, clarifying contributor rituals, and ensuring teammates have a frictionless, safe path through the DB patch workflow. No logic changes. No schema changes. Just clarity, safety, and narrative coherence.\n\nWhat this PR adds\n1. Safety & clarity in PR templates\n- Added explicit guidance on triggering automated parsing via /introspect <url>.\n- Added a clear reminder not to paste secrets (DB URL, service role key) into PR comments.\n- Linked directly to INTROSPECTION.md for artifact generation instructions.\n2. Improved discoverability in INTROSPECTION.md\n- Added a concise section explaining how to trigger automated parsing.\n- Reinforced the safety boundary around secrets.\n3. Contributor workflow refinement\n- Added a DB Patch Workflow section to CONTRIBUTING.md, outlining introspection  patch  validate.\n4. Repo hygiene\n- .gitignore updated to exclude introspection logs, zips, and parser outputs.\n- .gitattributes marks logs and artifacts as generated to avoid noisy diffs.\n\nWhy this matters\nThese refinements dont change behavior  they strengthen the scaffolding around the introspection system. They make the workflow safer, clearer, and easier to review.\n\nNext steps\nOnce the first full introspection artifact arrives, the parser + SQL patch arc can begin immediately. This PR ensures the path is clean and ready.
