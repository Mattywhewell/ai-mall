# Temporary CI trigger for RSC abort analysis

**Do not merge** — this PR exists only to collect Playwright traces and server logs for analysis.

Purpose:
- Run full CI matrix with Playwright trace collection enabled.
- Provide traces for `scripts/ci/rtr-sweep.js` to analyze prefetch aborts and correlate abort timestamps with server-side logs.

When finished:
- Close the PR and delete the branch; do not merge.

Generated by automated tooling to trigger CI for diagnostics.
