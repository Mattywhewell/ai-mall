Usage notes:
- For consistent style across portraits, keep the same artist/style keywords (e.g., "cinematic photorealism, subtle painterly texture, 8k") in each prompt.
- Recommended aspect ratio: `3:4` or `4:5` for portrait crops.
- For web delivery, export at 1600×2133 (4:5) or 1200×1600 (3:4) for high-res PNGs, and also keep SVG/vector placeholders for fast loads.
- To preserve identity across regenerations, lock seeds where supported and document seed values alongside outputs.
